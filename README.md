## About

Time.  What is it?

We cannot see it, but it is all around us.  Is it a color our eyes cannot see?

We cannot touch it, yet it passes through us and we pass through it.  Is it a medium like air or water that our finngers cannot feel?

How do we know it is there?

How do we experience it or measure it?

## Issues
